# Contributing

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to resource-toolkit.

## Setting up development environment

All you gotta do in the cloned repo is install the dependencies using Node 12:

```sh
npm install
```

Open the folder with your code editor and start coding. It'll be great if
your editor supports Prettier too.

### Tests

Make sure you the code you're adding has decent test coverage.

Running project tests and coverage:

```sh
npm test
```

### Commit Guidelines

The project uses the commitizen tool for standardizing changelog style commit and a git pre-commit hook to enforce them.
