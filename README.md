## About

Often we consume RESTful APIs using reactive UIs with React, and there are a few state scenarios always present:
- Loading:
  - Is the loading a creation request and you want to disable or hide the creation form buttons?
  - Is the loading a reading operation and only a blinking skeleton is supposed to fill that table?
  - Or maybe you're updating a single row and you only want to disable that specific row action buttons with a cute spinning instead of disabling that creation form?
  - And if
- No data found
- Stacking error messages

While this is not a UI lib, it's a state helper to handle all of these state changes above.
