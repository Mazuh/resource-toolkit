## About

Often we consume RESTful APIs, like for a [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete), using reactive UIs (with React or not). And there are a few state scenarios always present and our UI demands some questions to be answered:
- Loading state
  - Is the loading a creation request and you want to disable or hide the creation form buttons?
  - Is the loading a reading operation and only a blinking skeleton is supposed to fill that table?
  - Or maybe you're updating a single row and you only want to disable that specific row action buttons with a cute spinning instead of disabling that creation form?
  - What if the loading is actually a deleting action?
  - And if all of that is happening at the same time?
  - Did you consider these loadings to have a minimal (and [pleasant](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-response-times/)) delay?
- Easy feedback for no data found
- Stacking error messages
- Repetitive fetching messages
  - For example, success messages for when something was successfully deleted
  - Another example, an error message when some specific request HTTP verb failed
- Data fetching itself
  - Bored of having to write the same `filter` when you remove elements for your data?
  - Or tired of writing the same `map` for editing?
  - Or being confused with all that spread and rest operations for adding new stuff?

While this is not a UI lib, it's a state helper to automate all of these state changes above.
It's type safed, has high test coverage (written with [TDD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development)).
Your code commits using this for repetitive CRUDs will be short, readable,
safer by [pure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function) automation. You'll be free to focus
on crafting other complex designed behaviours.

This lib is a composition mostly pure
functions (based on [Reducer pattern](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern/)),
so It's also supposed to be easily integrated on any state manager you're using, like
[Redux](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/) or just raw
[React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-overview.html) (or even class-based life cycle methods).

## Install

```bash
npm install --save resource-toolkit
```

## Example

You may already see a running To Do List application
here, crafted for didactic reasons with a friend:
https://github.com/Mazuh/octo-todo (**warning**: it is currently using an old version unstable version)

## Usage

Here are a few dumb examples in React.

### Simple example for fetching all

```js
import React from "react";
import { makeReducerAssets } from 'resource-toolkit';

const usersResource = makeReducerAssets({
  name: 'user',
  idKey: 'userId',
  gateway: {
    fetchMany: async (ids = null, ...args) => {
      return [
        { userId: 42, name: 'Marcell' },
        { userId: 11, name: 'David' },
        { userId: 22, name: 'Rodrigo' },
      ];
    },
  },
});

export default function App() {
  const [users, dispatch] = React.useReducer(usersResource.reducer, usersResource.initialState);

  React.useEffect(() => {
    usersResource.actions.readAll()(dispatch);
  }, [dispatch]);

  if (users.isLoading) {
    return <p>Doing something...</p>;
  }

  if (users.items.length === 0) {
    return <p>No users found.</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <ul>
        {users.items.map(user => (
          <li key={user.userId}>{user.name}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </div>
  );
}
```
